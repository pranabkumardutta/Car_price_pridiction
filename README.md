1. Project Overview

       This project is a machine learning-based system that predicts the price of used cars based on key attributes such as brand, fuel type, transmission, condition, model, age, engine size, and mileage.
       The goal was to build a reliable tool that helps estimate fair car prices for buyers and sellers.

2. Key Features

       ðŸ“Š Feature Engineering: Preprocessed categorical features with OneHotEncoder and scaled numerical features with StandardScaler.

       ðŸ¤– Model Selection: Implemented RandomForestRegressor for robust prediction due to its ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships.

       ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy using RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

       ðŸ’» Interactive Deployment: Built a Streamlit app so users can input car details and instantly get predicted prices.

3. Tech Stack

       Machine Learning: scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor, Pipeline, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler)

       Programming: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib for analysis)
 
       Deployment: Streamlit for an interactive user interface

4. Why This Project Stands Out

       Demonstrates ability to build an end-to-end ML pipeline (data preprocessing â†’ model training â†’ evaluation â†’ deployment).

       Covers feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment, which are core real-world ML skills.

The Streamlit app makes the project interactive and practical, showing you can bridge ML with user-friendly applications.

Predicting car prices is a real-world business use case, so it resonates with recruiters and interviewers.
